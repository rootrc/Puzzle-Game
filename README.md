Known Bugs: 
* Undo button sometimes does not work, however is never permanent
* Winning message (only the winning message) may not load, being instead replaced with "You puzzled"
* In later levels, lasers may flicker violently
* Loading levels may take a couple frames, letting you see the previous level

Note: Due to the inability to save data between executions of the program,levels can be played in any order

Personal ranking of level difficulty and star difficulty. SS is the hardest, and D the easiest. 
It's assumed the player is playing the levels in the intended order, and thus learning in the intended order.
